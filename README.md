### Description
Have you ever got that feeling like you want to eat but spend an hour to decide which place to go to? Or you are accompanied by friends and want to go eat, but cannot agree on one place? Simply want to try something new? Ever flipped a coin on that matter? No need to anymore! Randogo is an app that will help you resolve the trouble of figuring out which place to go with a girl, where to buy your new shoes or get custom suit, play billiards or get your nails look stunning. This app will not only help you find out where you should go specifically, but also will provide you with all the information needed to get there: we let you know where the place is and how to get to there, what its ratings according to Yelp are, and all is needed on your side is to roll an imaginary die by shaking your phone. Randogo will become your best assistant by finding out places with the highest ratings that are within the distance you specify.
